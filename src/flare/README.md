# FLARE
package for analysing observations of galaxies.

Requires the environment $FLARE be set. This points to a folder containing a sub-folder "data/" which contains various data products you might need (e.g. filter transmission curves, SSP models etc.). SMW's data folder can be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/14gpntd1vlf56ee/AACsLjLbADZcVlmUVuaOgYQda?dl=0.

to install: type "make install" after cloning. This should (in theory) also install the FLARE package.
